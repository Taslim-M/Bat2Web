# Classification and Behaviour Analysis of Bat Echolocation Calls using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms


# CNN (AI) Model
We developed a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model specifically tailored for classifying bat species in edge devices. This model utilizes the Mel-scaled Filter Bank (MSFB) representation of audio segments. Emphasizing the need for deployment on edge devices, the model was meticulously designed to be compact. The original CNN model was constructed using the TensorFlow framework, and its architecture is depicted in Figure in the main page.
