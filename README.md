# DeepLearningBatDetector
This project has several components to it. Unfortunately, the ML development codes are not very organized.
However, inside Application_Server/, you can find the associated codes for the client-server part.

This is an end-to-end project for bat classification using IoT devices. More information about our project is in our papers (see the last section).

The Following Sections will Summarize the various components. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further information.

This project was selected as one of the top 3 in our engineering capstone project competition and the top-10 finalists for the Dell undergraduate capstone project competition.
