# DeepLearningBatDetector
This project has several components to it. Unfortunately, the ML development codes is not very organised.
However, inside Application_Server/ you can find the associated codes for the client server part.

To understand the project, you can view this video on YouTube: [VIDEO](https://youtu.be/9pw_I2N22yo)
