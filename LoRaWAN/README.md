# Classification and Behaviour Analysis of Bat Echolocation Calls using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Algorithms

# Network Communication Flow

The LoRa Raspberry Pi Gateway serves as the middle-man during the communications, as it will receive the messages from the edge device over the LoRaWAN protocol, and forward them to The Things Network (TTN) broker. This gateway was configured to follow the relevant LoRa channel for our region (EU 863-870), and was registered in The Things Network web portal.

The ESP32 Microcontroller purchased is from: https://besomi.com/product/sparkfun-esp32-thing/?gclid=CjwKCAiA8YyuBhBSEiwA5R3-E_H-2Guie5WXec7DYYcWiYxxUhkV4rlJETaccGMYC4hCx7Ya5Y-fbRoC8tIQAvD_BwE
